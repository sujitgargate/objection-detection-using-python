# objection-detection-using-python

This project will help to detect tip of provided object. Python script will capture image using camera and process it. 

As it works on cornerHaris algorithm so you need to be careful of in which direction the light is coming.

There is no doubt this algorithum is very powerfull but if developer take care of few things he can do much more things using this scrips.

I'm also attaching arduino servo motor file where python sends the signal to arduino about detected object fits in criteria or not.

I hope this helps to somebody and developes something innovative.
